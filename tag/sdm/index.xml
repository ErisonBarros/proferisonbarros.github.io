      <title>Effect of Landscape Modifications and Climate Changes on the Persistence of Amphibians in the Atlantic Forest</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lack of knowledge about the diversity and distribution of species is one of the main challenges for conservation. Allied to this fact, the  processes resulting from the modifications of the landscape and climate  changes are among the main causes of the loss of world biodiversity,  further aggravating the unfamiliar scenario. Amphibians are among the  vertebrate groups most sensitive to these changes, mainly due to their  particular morphological and ecological characteristics. The Atlantic  Forest Biome still has a high diversity of amphibians and is considered  one of the most threatened biodiversity &lt;em&gt;hotspots&lt;/em&gt; in the world.  Therefore, in this project we will seek: (1) to present an assessment of the surveys of the amphibian communities for the Atlantic Forest, their composition and distribution; (2) to investigate how habitat loss and  fragmentation on the regional scale can affect the current persistence  of amphibians from different reproductive guilds; and (3) to investigate how climate change may affect the future persistence of amphibians of  the genus &lt;em&gt;Brachycephalus&lt;/em&gt;, considered highly sensitive to these climatic  changes. To carry out this project will be used descriptive and spatial  analyzes of the surveys of amphibian communities and Ecological Niche  Models to find suitable areas for the species. We hope to find an  overview of the diversity of amphibian communities and sampling gaps  along the Atlantic Forest. In addition, we expect species with aquatic  reproductive modes to be more affected by the effects of fragmentation  than species with direct development, which will be more affected by  habitat loss. Finally, we expect that the areas currently suitable for  the occurrence of species of the genus &lt;em&gt;Brachycephalus&lt;/em&gt; will suffer a  drastic decrease in the future and will be located in higher altitudes&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effect of fragmentation on the persistence of anuran amphibians within the Atlantic Forest</title>
      <link>https://mauriciovancine.github.io/project/fapesp_2013/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amphibians are sensitive to habitat loss, fragmentation and habitat quality, particularly because their limited mobility over large distances and high dependence of microhabitats for reproduction. The Atlantic Rainforest has about 400 species of amphibians, and 60 to 85% of them are endemic. Nowadays the Atlantic Rainforest is reduced to 11.4% - 16.0% of its original cover, with 80% of fragments &amp;lt; 50 ha, isolated and poorly connected. Therefore, understanding how the process of fragmentation influences the persistence of amphibians within the Atlantic Rainforest is essential for the development of strategic planning for species conservation. This study will evaluate the effect of landscape structure, relief and levels of urbanization at the regional scale on the persistence of species &lt;em&gt;Vitreorana eurygnatha&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vitreorana uranoscopa&lt;/em&gt;. These two species are forest-dependent and have aquatic breeding, therefore are extremely susceptible to fragmentation. To carry out the study, the following steps will be taken: (i) model the potential distribution based on the environmental suitability of the species of interest, (ii) identify landscapes with high environmental suitability and surveys with high sampling effort in order to characterize the regional anurofauna, (iii) evaluate the relative contribution of landscape indices (percentage of forest cover, connectivity, relief and urban proximity) to the persistence of species using model selection for multiple competing hypotheses based on Akaike information theory.&lt;/p&gt;
